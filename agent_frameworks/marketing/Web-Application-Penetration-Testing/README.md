## 🌍 OWASP Top 10 (2025) - Key Vulnerabilities

This repository provides an in-depth analysis of the latest **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities to ensure you understand modern web security threats.

### 🔹 A01:2021 - Broken Access Control
- Ranked #1 due to 94% of applications exhibiting some form of access control issues.
- Covers **34 Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs)** related to access control flaws.

### 🔹 A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures
- Previously known as **Sensitive Data Exposure**.
- Focuses on failures in cryptographic implementations leading to data leaks or system compromise.

### 🔹 A03:2021 - Injection
- Includes **SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other code injection flaws**.
- Found in 94% of tested applications.

### 🔹 A04:2021 - Insecure Design
- Emphasizes **threat modeling, secure design patterns, and reference architectures**.

### 🔹 A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration
- Often caused by **misconfigured application settings, cloud services, and security controls**.

### 🔹 A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- Formerly **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**.
- One of the most challenging issues to test and mitigate.

### 🔹 A07:2021 - [Identification and Authentication Failures](./Wpt/Server-side_topics/Authentication_vulnerabilities)
- Previously **Broken Authentication**.
- Common misconfigurations still lead to authentication security issues.

### 🔹 A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures
- Includes **Insecure Deserialization** and risks related to **CI/CD pipelines**.
